# APIcurious - FitBit Dashboard Reconstruction

## Overview

This project uses the FitBit API to implement a 3rd party app that uses OAuth 2.0 to log users in via FitBit and to consume their data to display a similar looking dashboard. It utilizes the [LazyHighCharts gem](https://github.com/michelson/lazy_high_charts) to create interactive graphs for sleep, activity, and resting heart rate.
